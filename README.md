# Supermarket Simulation (MCMC)

This project is a supermarket simulation designed to predict customer satisfaction using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model. The simulation is written in Python and utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Overview

The supermarket simulation is designed to mimic the behavior of customers in a real supermarket, and uses an MCMC model to predict customer satisfaction. The simulation takes into account product availability to make predictions about customer satisfaction.

The project is written in Python and utilizes OOP principles to organize the simulation code.
